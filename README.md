This is a brief problem statement to evaluate your comfort with web3 and supabase. Please add a PR with your code once done

## Problem statement

We are building a simple web3 auth mechanism, and link that to supabase in the backend. Here is the objective

1. A user lands on a login screen with a single option to connect wallet
2. On connecting the wallet / signing a message, register a new user in a supabase project. And set the session to logged in
3. In the logged in state, redirect the user to a screen, where the users wallet address and ENS name (if available) is displayed
4. Logout on this screen should take the user back to the main screen

## Tools required - all free versions

1. NextJS - deploy on vercel please
2. Tailwind - for basic CSS
3. Supabase
4. Any node provider of your choice for ENS resolution

For any questions, ping on whatsapp please
